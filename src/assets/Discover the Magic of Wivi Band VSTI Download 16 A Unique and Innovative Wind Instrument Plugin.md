## What is Wivi Band VSTi?
 
Wivi Band VSTi is a software instrument that simulates wind instruments using physical modeling synthesis. Physical modeling synthesis is a technique that uses mathematical equations to describe the physical properties and interactions of sound-producing objects such as tubes, valves, reeds, bells and mouthpieces. By solving these equations in real time, Wivi Band VSTi can generate realistic and expressive sounds that respond to the player's input and articulation.
 
Wivi Band VSTi includes 10 different wind instruments: Bb-Trumpet, Tenor Trombone, French Horn, F-Tuba, Concert Flute, A-Clarinet, Modern Oboe, Modern Bassoon, Tenor Saxophone and Soprano Recorder. Each instrument has its own characteristics and features such as mute types, vibrato types, key noise and breath noise. Wivi Band VSTi also allows you to play solo or in sections of up to 8 players with automatic divisi. Divisi is a musical term that means dividing a section of players into smaller groups that play different parts. For example, you can have a section of 4 trumpets playing in harmony or in unison with Wivi Band VSTi.
  
## Why use Wivi Band VSTi?
 
Wivi Band VSTi is a great tool for composers, producers, arrangers and musicians who want to create realistic and expressive wind instrument parts for their music projects. Wivi Band VSTi can be used for various genres and styles of music such as classical, jazz, pop, rock, film score and more. Wivi Band VSTi can also be used for educational purposes such as learning how to play wind instruments or how to write for wind sections.
 
Wivi Band VSTi has many advantages over traditional sample-based instruments. First of all, Wivi Band VSTi has a very small footprint on your computer's memory and disk space. The installer file is only about 20 MB and the plugin itself uses less than 10 MB of RAM. This means that you can load multiple instances of Wivi Band VSTi without worrying about performance issues or loading times. Secondly, Wivi Band VSTi has a very simple and intuitive interface that lets you access all the features and parameters easily. You don't need to browse through hundreds of presets or menus to find the sound you want. Thirdly, Wivi Band VSTi has a very high sound quality and realism that rivals or even surpasses some of the best sample libraries on the market.

For example, you can control the attack, decay, sustain and release of each note with your MIDI controller or breath controller. You can also change the timbre and tone of each note by adjusting the mouthpiece position or the embouchure. You can also create smooth transitions between notes and dynamics without any artifacts or glitches.
