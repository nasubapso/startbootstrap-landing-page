## Step 2: Burn the ISO file to a DVD or a USB drive
  
The next step is to burn the ISO file to a DVD or a USB drive using a tool like Rufus[^1^]. Rufus is a free and easy-to-use program that can create bootable media from ISO files. You can download Rufus from its official website and run it on your PC. Then, follow these steps:
  
- Insert your DVD or USB drive into your PC.
- Select your DVD or USB drive from the Device list in Rufus.
- Select "ISO Image" from the Boot selection menu and click on the Select button to browse for the ISO file you downloaded.
- Make sure the Partition scheme is set to "MBR" and the Target system is set to "BIOS or UEFI".
- Click on the Start button to begin the process. Rufus will warn you that all data on your DVD or USB drive will be erased. Click on OK to confirm.
- Wait for Rufus to finish burning the ISO file to your DVD or USB drive. This may take several minutes depending on the speed of your drive and your PC.

## Step 3: Boot from the DVD or USB drive
  
The final step is to boot from the DVD or USB drive that contains Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 X64 20in1 Pre-Activated En-US Sept 2013 Serial Key Keygen. To do this, you need to change the boot order in your PC's BIOS settings. The BIOS settings are different for each PC model, so you may need to consult your PC's manual or search online for instructions on how to access them. Generally, you can access them by pressing a certain key (such as F2, F10, F12, Esc or Del) during the startup process.
  
Once you are in the BIOS settings, look for an option that lets you change the boot order or boot priority. Move your DVD or USB drive to the top of the list, so that it is the first device that your PC tries to boot from. Save and exit the BIOS settings.
  
Your PC should now restart and boot from the DVD or USB drive. You should see a message that says "Press any key to boot from CD/DVD" or "Press any key to boot from USB". Press any key to continue.
